Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a frontend engineer on a journey to find purpose, improve my skills, and share what I learn along the way. Whether you're a fellow developer, a learner, or just curious, I hope you'll find something helpful or inspiring here.

This blog is inspired by creators like Anthony Fu, whose work showed me how beautiful and impactful a personal site can be. I'm still learning English and growing every day—so you'll see my progress (and maybe a few mistakes) as I go!

**Why this blog?**

I believe everyone has something unique to share, even if they're still figuring things out. Here, I document my experiences, lessons, and challenges as I grow in tech and life. If you're on a similar path, you're not alone!
