# Building a Performant Web Application

Performance is crucial for user experience. A slow website can frustrate users and hurt your conversion rates. Let's explore some key strategies for building performant web applications.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals are essential metrics for measuring user experience:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measures interactivity
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measures visual stability

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Code Splitting

Split your JavaScript bundles to load only what's needed:

```javascript
// Dynamic import
const module = await import('./heavy-module.js');
```

### 2. Image Optimization

Always optimize images:

- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading
- Serve responsive images with `srcset`

### 3. Minimize JavaScript

Less JavaScript means faster pages:

- Remove unused code
- Use tree shaking
- Consider SSR or SSG

### 4. Caching Strategy

Implement effective caching:

- Use service workers
- Set proper cache headers
- Leverage CDN caching

## Measuring Performance

Use tools like:

- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest
- Chrome DevTools Performance panel

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Start with the biggest wins and iterate based on real user data.
